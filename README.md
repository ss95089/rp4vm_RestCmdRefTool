# rp4vm_RestCmdRefTool

This tool replaces and displays RecoverPoint for VMs operations in Curl commands (REST API).  
I created this tool as a confirmation tool for job control of RecoverPoint for VMs from job management software.  
The supported operations are as follows
 - ProtectVM
 - Add MV to existing Consistency Group
 - Create Bookmark
 - Test a Copy
 - Failover / Recover Production
 - Rmove CG

*Group sets and multi-site copying are not supported.
